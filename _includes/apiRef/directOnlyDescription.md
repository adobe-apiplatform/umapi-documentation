Controls whether the groups value in the returned user structure contains only user groups and product configurations of which that user is a direct member. If false is specified for this parameter, then all user groups containing the user are returned, and additionally all product configurations are returned for which the user has an entitlement, whether that entitlement comes directly (via user assignment) or indirectly (via a user group that contains the user being assigned to the product configuration). If true is specified for this parameter, then all user groups containing the user are returned, and additionally only those product configurations are returned to which the user has been explicitly assigned an entitlement. Please note that it is possible for a user to be in a product configuration both directly and indirectly, as well as indirectly via multiple user groups. In such cases, even if the directOnly parameter is false, the product configuration will only appear once in the groups.
