# Adobe: User Management API: User Groups

# User Groups

The following set of APIs allow users to perform management of their organization's [user-groups](glossary.md#user-group). Management operations include create, read, update and delete for user-groups.
_User-groups_ can be used to organize related users together and assign them to products. A user-group is a collection of different users that share a set of permissions. There are various permissions across different products that have to be assigned to many users in varying order. Managing permissions by user is not a sustainable model. The purpose of these APIs is to managing the user-groups. To associate user-groups with product profiles or users please see [Action API](TBD).

# <a href="getUserGroups">GET /v2/usermanagement/{orgId}/user-groups</a>

This API returns all the user-groups for the given organization. Successful queries will return a 200 response whose body is a JSON response representing an array of [user-groups](glossary.md#user-group). The response is paginated and specific pages are requested by using query parameter `page=x`, where x is a number.   

### Example Requests:
Retrieve the first page of user-groups:
```
 curl -ivs -X GET \
   http://usermanagement.adobe.io/jil-api/v2/usermanagement/28E1E2EB570F90057F000101@AdobeOrg/user-groups \
   -H 'authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
   -H 'content-type: application/json' \
   -H 'x-request-id: user-assigned-request-id' \
   -H 'x-api-key: jilservice_admin1' 
 ```
 Retrieve the 3rd page of user-groups:
 ```
 curl -ivs -X GET \
   http://usermanagement.adobe.io/jil-api/v2/usermanagement/28E1E2EB570F90057F000101@AdobeOrg/user-groups?page=3 \
   -H 'authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
   -H 'content-type: application/json' \

# <a href="updateUserGroup">PUT /v2/usermanagement/{orgId}/user-groups/{groupId}</a>

Enables the updating of the name and/or description of an existing [user-group](glossary.md#user-group). The user-group name and description provide the administrator a means of identifying what a particular user-group represents. When the exact nature of an existing group changes a system administrator may wish to update the user-group with a new name or description. For instance the group "DevOps" might be changed to "CloudOps". As the user-group `groupId` is the identifier, this operation will not affect users who are already a member of the user-group or their access to any associated product profiles.  

### Example Request:
```
 curl -ivs -X PUT \
   http://usermanagement.adobe.io/jil-api/v2/usermanagement/28E1E2EB570F90057F000101@AdobeOrg/user-groups/49371437 \
