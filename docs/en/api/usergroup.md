# User Groups

The following set of APIs allow users to perform management of their organization's [user-groups](glossary.html#usergroup). Management operations include create, read, update and delete for user-groups.
_User-groups_ can be used to organize related users together and assign them to products. A user-group is a collection of different users that share a set of permissions. There are various permissions across different products that have to be assigned to many users in varying order. The purpose of these APIs is to manage the user-groups. To associate user-groups with Product Profiles or users please see [products page](Product.html).
