  * "active": Normal status for a user account in good standing.
  * "disabled": Disabled temporarily - user is not allowed to login, but is not removed.
  * "locked": Disabled permanently - user is not allowed to login, but is not removed.
  * "removed": The user account is being removed. 
* __type:__ _string_, The user type, one of: `{ "adobeID", "enterpriseID", "federatedID", "unknown" }`. See [Identity Types](glossary.md#identity) for more information.
