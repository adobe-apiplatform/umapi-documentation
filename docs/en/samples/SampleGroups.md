# Add and Remove Product Access

You can use the User Management API to control product access by managing the membership of User Groups and Product Profiles that you have created and named in the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise).

* To manage [memberships](#user-membership-actions) for users and User Groups, use the **add** and **remove** actions for an individual **user** or **usergroup**.
* To manage product [Admin roles](#manage-admin-roles) for a _user_, use the **addRoles** and **removeRoles** actions for the individual **user** and **product** configuration.
* To manage product Admin roles for a _product_, use the **addProductAdmin** and **removeProductAdmin** actions in a POST request to the product-specific endpoint.
* To manage [both membership and Admin roles for Product Profiles](#manage-membership-and-roles-for-a-product-configuration), send a POST request to the configuration-specific endpoint.

## Manage user memberships in User Groups and Product Profiles

You can manage memberships in an action for a "user" or in an action for a "usergroup".

### User membership actions

In the "do" list for a "user", add that user to membership in a User Group and two Product Profiles.

```json
========================= REQUEST ==========================
POST https://usermanagement.adobe.io/v2/usermanagement/action/{myOrgId}
-------------------------- body ----------------------------
[
  {
    "user" : "john.doe@myDomain",
    "do" : [
      {
        "add" : {
          "usergroup" : [
            "Marketing Reports & Analytics" ],
          "product" : [
            "MarketingCreative",
            "CreativeCloudComplete"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
------------------------- headers --------------------------
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {myApiKey}
Authorization: Bearer {myAccessToken}
```

### User Group membership actions

In the "do" list for a "usergroup", add the User Group as a member of two Product Profiles, and add a user as a member of the User Group. This gives the new group member access to the products.

```json
========================= REQUEST ==========================
POST https://usermanagement.adobe.io/v2/usermanagement/action/{myOrgId}
-------------------------- body ----------------------------
[
  {
    "usergroup" : "Marketing Reports & Analytics",
    "do" : [
      {
        "add" : {
           "product" : [
            "MarketingCreative",
            "CreativeCloudComplete"
          ],
           "user" : [ "ann.other@myCompany.com" ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
------------------------- headers --------------------------
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {myApiKey}
Authorization: Bearer {myAccessToken}
```

Remove memberships for a User Group

```json
========================= REQUEST ==========================
POST https://usermanagement.adobe.io/v2/usermanagement/action/{myOrgId}
-------------------------- body ----------------------------
[
  {
    "usergroup" : "Marketing Reports & Analytics",
    "do" : [
      {
        "remove" : {
          "product" : [
            "CreativeCloudComplete"
          ],
           "user" : [ "ann.other@myCompany.com" ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
 ------------------------- headers --------------------------
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {myApiKey}
Authorization: Bearer {myAccessToken}
```

## Manage Admin Roles

You can manage which users have the Admin role for products with a POST request to either the **action/{orgId}** endpoint or to the specific product endpoint, **{orgId}/products/{productId}**

You can also manage the user membership and roles for Product Profiles with a POST request to the specific configuration endpoint, **{orgId}/products/{productId}/configurations/{configId}**.

### Manage roles for a user

Add and remove the Admin role for a specific user in specific Product Profiles with a POST request to the **action/{orgId}** endpoint.

```json

        }
      }
      {
        "removeRoles" : {
          "productAdmin" : [
            "MarketingCreative2"
          ]
        }
